**Description:**

**Client Requirement:**
Common challenges addressed include:
1. Siloed data sources and 
2. Lack of business intelligence tools
3. Lack of a single source of truth

There have been identified multiple systems in the organization that operate as data integration repositories (integrating multiple data sources) and serve multiple consumers (either other systems, or stakeholders). Since managing and maintaining such data silos might create significant barriers to information and knowledge sharing, as well as to collaboration across units and stakeholders, there is a strategic decision for lean data management. In particular, one of the main objectives of this initiative is to extend DWH to build a Single-Point of Truth for the organization and act as a centralized repository providing reports and data to both stakeholders and consuming systems. 

**Our Solution:**
We equipped Bank with tools, knowledge and strategies to optimize banking delivery:
1.	Towards establishing the Single-Point of Truth of the organization. 
2.	Enhancing the data areas integrated into and served through the DWH. 
3. Cloud-native information architecture that is scalable, elastic, and future-ready.
